## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**PocketBase not running**
```
❌ PocketBase is not running!
```
**Solution**: Start PocketBase server first
```bash
cd pocketbase
pocketbase.exe serve
```

**Authentication failed**
```
❌ Authentication failed: Invalid credentials
```
**Solution**: 
1. Check your email and password
2. Create admin account at http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/
3. Use correct credentials

**Collections already exist**
```
ℹ️  Posts collection already exists
```
**Solution**: This is normal! The script handles existing collections gracefully.
